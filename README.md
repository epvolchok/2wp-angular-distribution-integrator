# Angular distribution and power of $2 \omega_p$ electromagnetic emission produced by nonlinear interaction of laser wakefields

Calculation of parameters of electromagnetic radiation (angular distribution and total power) in a wave zone of the source presented by colliding in plasma counter-propagating laser pulses. The problem statement: 
- [**Generation of high-field narrowband terahertz radiation by counterpropagating plasma wakefields**](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4993100)
- [**Electromagnetic emission due to nonlinear interaction of laser wakefields colliding in plasma at an oblique angle**](https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6587/abdcdb)

To calculate the angular distribution, one needs to deal with 6-fold integration of a fast oscillating functions. An algorithm for computing n-dimensional integral of a complex function has been developed. The author of the algorithm is [Vladimir Annenkov](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5577-8595), the implementation of the integrator for *CUDA* is by [Evgeniia Volchok](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8520-3207) and [Vladimir Annenkov](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5577-8595).
